                    </h5>
                    <h5>
                        You start learning how to survive by yourself, chopping down trees, mining rocks, finding other natural resources.
                        You start to realise that you can repair the hyperdrive on your ship, 
                        and with that you set out on a journey to find all of the needed materials to repair it.
                    </h5>
